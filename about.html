<p>The Asian Eats Directory is a global directory of local culinary food wisdom. Inspired by people sharing Asian restaurants in effort to support local businesses, Athena and Jason decided to create a more permanent collection of the recommendations they've been seeing on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, newspapers, and of course Reddit. Anything that can be a resource to local communities has been included: local lists, maps, and directories of Asian eateries for people to find great food and support local businesses.</p>
<br>
<p>While this project began to support East Asian businesses facing racism and tough times during Covid-19, we extend solidarity to all Asian communities. For us, Asia is broadly defined -- from Korea down to the tip of Indonesia, Japan, through the Middle East to the bank of the Bosphorus River in Istanbul.</p>

<p>All projects are linked to the original creators. Please click on the project and creator names to find delicious dishes from the Asian diaspora.</p>
<br>
<p>Contributors include Ashley Kang and annonymous contributors who helped with research and creating lists and maps. A big thank you to the people who are managing these directories for their communities!</p>
