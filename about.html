<p>The Asian Eats Directory is a global directory of local culinary food wisdom. Inspired by people sharing Asian restaurants to support local businesses, Athena and Jason created this collection based on shares on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, newspapers, and of course Reddit.</p>
<br>
<p>While this project began to support East Asian businesses facing racism and tough times during Covid-19, we extend solidarity to all Asian communities. Asia stretches from Korea down to the tip of Indonesia, Japan, through the Middle East to the bank of the Bosphorus River in Istanbul. Please click on the project and creator names to find delicious dishes from the Asian diaspora.</p>
<br>
<p>Contributors include Ashley Kang and annonymous contributors. A big thank you to the people who are managing these directories for their communities!</p>
